# Blockchain Voting System

This is a repository for our group project in the Introduction to Blockchain course at University of Eastern Finland. We will be using the [sanattaori/techdot](https://github.com/sanattaori/techdot) Aadhar voting project as a base for our project. This project provides a starting point for building a blockchain-based voting system, and we will be adding our own modifications and features to it.
